# VC Copilot Project Rules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Use 'use client' directive only when necessary (client components)
- Prefer server components by default
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns

## Database
- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Never bypass the ORM
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- **NEVER use test data, seed scripts, or mock data**
- Work with real production data only

## API Design
- All API routes in /app/api
- Return proper HTTP status codes
- Always return JSON
- Include error messages in responses
- Validate input with Zod or similar

## AI Agents
- Keep prompts in agent files, not scattered
- Log all AI calls for debugging
- Handle rate limits gracefully
- Cache results when appropriate

## Security
- Never commit API keys
- Use environment variables
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize AI outputs before rendering

## Performance
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement loading states
- Show progress for long operations
- Use React Query for data fetching

## Components
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Include loading and error states
- Make components reusable

## Testing
- Test API routes
- Test critical business logic
- Manual testing for UI flows
- **NO test data or seed scripts - production data only**

## Development Philosophy
- Build for real-world use from day one
- No placeholder or dummy data
- Every feature must work with actual user data
